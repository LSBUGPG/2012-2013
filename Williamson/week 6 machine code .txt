registers - ram instructions

Set these values in ram at start of program:

Character health = 100
Enemy Touch = 0

RAM	: Data

0x0000	: characterHealth 
0x0001  : enemyTouch 
0x0002	: resetButton

ROM	: code		notes

loop

0x0000	: 0x0000 	load RAM address of characterHealth to address register
0x0001	: 0xfc10	load value of characterHealth to Data Register
0x0002 	:		load ROM address End to address register
0x0003 	: 0xe306	jump to End if data register is zero
0x0004	: 0x0001	load RAM address of EnemyTouch into Address Register
0x0005 	: 0xfc10	load value of EnemyTouch into Data Register (one input of ALU)
0x0006	: 0x0000	load RAM address of characterHealth into address register (second input of alu)
0x0007	: 0xe1c8 (A-B)	load (value of characterHealth - value of Enemy Touch) to value of characterHealth in RAM (not sure if this is B-A or B-1)

jump to loop

0x0008	: 0x0000
______



Health = 100


: Loop

load RAM address of Health into Address Register (an address value, top bit not set)
load value of Health into Data Register (an instruction value do this by programing the a,c,d and j bits (in Hex))
load ROM address of End into Address Register (an address value)
jump to End if Data Register = 0  (an instruciton value to do this)



Read value of Reset Button

If value of Reset Button = 1 then set value of Health to 100


Read value of Enemy Touch

If value of Enemy Touch = 1 then set value of Health to Health - 1

(e.g.

load RAM address of Enemy Touch into Address Register
load value of Enemy Touch into Data Register (one input of ALU)
load RAM address of Health into Address Register (and therefore the second input to ALU)
load value Health - value Enemy Touch into value Health in RAM (ALU function)
)


Goto Loop



: End

Read value of Reset Button

If value of Reset Button = 1 then set value of Health to 100

Goto Loop
