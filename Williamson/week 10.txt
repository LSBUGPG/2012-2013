In order to optimize the scripts in my game I can use loops as well as functions that call other scripts.

For example I could use a GUI manager script to handle several similar things, and in other scripts use a function that calls to this scripts.

e.g

guiManager.needKey = true

This will then change something in the gui manager script and mean I dont have to have gui functions spread all over different scripts that it relates to.
