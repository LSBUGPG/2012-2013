For my game idea where the player moves around the screen and is chased by objects that constantly move towards them. 
player has certain amounts of lives and when they loose them all the game is over. Their high score is the time they survive.

If they last 100 seconds without dying they get another life.


if (lives == 0) { gameOver; }

if (health + (-damage) < 0) { loseLife; }

if (time == 100) { addLife; }

if (time +(-100) == 0) { addLife; }
