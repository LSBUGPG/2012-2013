I can use loops to destroy and keep my bullet count low enough for the game to work. 

instead of 

function Fire()
{
	print("I'm firing the gun");
	var bulletIns = Instantiate(bulletPrefab, spawnSocket.position, spawnSocket.rotation);

I would use a script on the spawner to destroy the bullets after an amount of time if they have not hit an enemy.

e.g. 

public var lifeTime : int = 2;


function Awake () {
	Destroy(gameObject, lifeTime);

}
